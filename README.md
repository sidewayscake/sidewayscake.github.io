# Sideways Cake

## ...What?

Watch S1 E19 of Bizaardvark for context.

## Instructions

The aim of the game is to bet on whether the cake will be sideways or upright. You can choose how many credits you'd like to bet on your decision by using the number box under the "I bet" label. Next, if you're betting that the cake will not be sideways, tap the green "will" label. It will change to "won't". If you've changed your mind, tap it again to go back to "will". When you've decided, click the big "Bet" button. Use your credits wisely, because when you get to 0, it's game over.
